## Redfin Coding Challenge

# Getting started:
  ○ download zipped folder and save to local folder
  ○ install Ruby 2.4.1 or later https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/
  ○ open terminal `cd ~/redfin_challenge`
  ○ `bundle install` in terminal to acquire necessary dependencies (namely: 'soda-ruby')
  ○ `ruby main.rb`

#What to do differently for a full-scale web application
  As a full-scale web application, I would separate this application into front-end UI and backend web-server components, and possibly a database component used to store or evaluate user input. Error handling in an CLI program is rigid and confined to prompting, in a full-scale application I would use a dynamic framework like React to error handle in a more flexible and effective way. Building this out as a webapp would also be beneficial for making changes and updates to the application, because CLI programs must be downloaded. 


○ install dependencies.
○ build your program.
○ run your program, with example commands on how to run it if necessary.
3. A one- or two-paragraph write-up that is no more than 250 words describing, at a high
level, what you would do differently if you were asked to build this as a full-scale web
application. In your write-up, please focus on the technical differences between the
command-line program and the web application, rather than on the product differences.
