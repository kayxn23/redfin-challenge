## Redfin Coding Challenge

# Getting started:
  - clone the repo
  - install Ruby 2.4.1 or later https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/
  - open terminal `cd ~/redfin_challenge`
  - `bundle install` in terminal to acquire necessary dependencies (namely: 'soda-ruby')
  - `ruby main.rb` to run the program

# What to do differently for a full-scale web application:
  As a full-scale web application, I would separate this application into front-end UI and backend web-server components, and possibly a database component used to store or evaluate user input. Error handling in an CLI program is rigid and confined to prompting, in a full-scale application I would use a dynamic framework like React to error handle in a more flexible and effective way. Building this out as a webapp would also be beneficial for making changes and updates to the application, because CLI programs must be downloaded.
